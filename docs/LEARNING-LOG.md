## 2026-10-02: first live calls from Vercel (slice 1)

**What we expected:** Backstory queries take 50–150 ms from a laptop, so a Vercel function next to Convex would answer well under Alexa's 500 ms limit, every time.

**What happened:**
- Warm production calls (20 each, `scripts/smoke.mjs`): `find_station_story` p50 105 ms, p95 179 ms; `get_station_story` p50 111 ms, worst 1,002 ms.
- Right after a deploy, the first calls took 746–835 ms, and the very first search hit our 350 ms Backstory cut-off, so the listener would have heard "I can't reach Radio Milwaukee's stories right now".
- Real use found three problems unit tests didn't: the story search matched the wrong episode on one shared word ("shop"); the story card couldn't read its bundled script inside Vercel's function (fixed by embedding it at install time); Next.js' generated types were missing in CI.
- Alexa+ onboarding stopped at Amazon's access step: their developer-tools role doesn't yet trust our AWS account.

**What we now believe:** Speed is fine once warm; the risk is cold starts, which need either keep-warm traffic or always-on instances before the demo. Every new surface (search quality, the card, the deploy) needs one real end-to-end call before we trust it.
